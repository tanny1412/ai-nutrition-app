# Nutrition Guidelines

## Macronutrients
- Protein: 0.8-1.0 g per kg bodyweight daily for general health; up to 1.6 g/kg for active individuals.
- Carbohydrates: 45-65% of total daily calories, prioritizing complex carbs and fiber >25 g/day.
- Fats: 20-35% of total calories, emphasizing unsaturated fats and limiting saturated fats <10%.

## Micronutrients
- Iron: 18 mg/day for adult women, 8 mg/day for adult men.
- Calcium: 1000 mg/day for adults 19-50 years old.
- Vitamin D: 600 IU/day for adults, higher for limited sun exposure.
- Vitamin B12: 2.4 mcg/day, ensure supplementation for vegans.

## Hydration
- Drink 30-35 ml of water per kg bodyweight daily as a baseline.
- Increase fluids during intense activity or hot climates.

## Meal Timing
- Distribute protein evenly across meals (~20-30 g/meal).

## Special Considerations
- Athletes: Increase carbohydrates around training and rehydrate with electrolytes.

- Diabetes: Pair carbohydrates with protein/fat, monitor glycemic load, aim for 25-30 g fiber/day.
